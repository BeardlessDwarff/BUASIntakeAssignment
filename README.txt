MECHANICS

Red Blocks:
These are the standard blocks. 

- running into them stops your movement.
- bouncing into them sends you the oppesite way with reduced speed.

Blue Blocks: 
These stick blocks have some unique interactions

- Touching one debuffs the slime reducing its speed.
- Allows the slime to climb horizontal. (Currently some bugs with the collision system cause this to be finicky
- Vertical jumping on stick blocks is greatly reduced.


ABOUT
This game is being made for a BUAS intake assignment.
As i am writing this i have been coding two days and learning C++

The edventual goal of this 2D platformer is to make level be time trialed.
the player must try and complete level as fast as possible.

This will be made intresting with differnt blocks, jumping mechanics and adventually dangerous mechanics such 
as Water that might dissolve the slim cause a reset.
